# GarrysMod-RP-Map-Unfinished
**Half-done Garry's Mod RP map-parts to use freely.**

Between 2009 and 2012, I spent hundreds of hours to create the best RP map I could dream of.
Sadly it was never finished, but the files I worked on were restored.
I'm sharing these half-finished map parts hoping that one day they make it into an actual finished map.
I focused on the bare structures only: walls, stairs, standard window and door frames, and their textures.
They are not perfect, I could spot many errors while looking around, but it is what it is.
If you manage to use any of the parts in your maps, please send me a message, I would love to see it.
You could put together all the pieces, add some details, and you got a working RP map.

## Builds

I compiled some of the parts into actual playable maps for testing, these can be dropped into the Garry's Mod maps folder and tried right away. The lights might be missing from some places. You can find the individual map parts in the map_parts folder.

### [square_office_police](builds)
Combination of the "square", "office" and "police" map parts put into one, as they were planned to be.

### [garages](builds)
This part would override the area between the "office" and "police".

### [de_alley_extended](builds)
An L4D-inspired map part "alley" combined with "office" made into an actual playable CS:S map.
